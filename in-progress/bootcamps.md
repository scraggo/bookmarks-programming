### Google: online web bootcamp

## The Issues
- Schedule: will I be available full time, or try to work around job?
- Cost: can I defer payment until I have a job?
- Custom curriculum: Learning what I want to learn
- Job placement

## My situation
I am a 33 year old musician looking to change careers. I've been learning Python and JavaScript for about a year and have worked with HTML and CSS for many years. I've recently decided to follow a fullstack web development track. This would include React.js, Node, a database language (amongst other crucial programming tools). I have a portfolio of small front-end projects, but am interested in making a much more impressive portfolio. I am looking to pay a minimum up front and defer payment until I've gained employment.
