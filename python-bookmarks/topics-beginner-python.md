In general, compound statements span multiple lines, although in simple incarnations a whole compound statement may be contained in one line. The if, while and for statements implement traditional control flow constructs. try specifies exception handlers and/or cleanup code for a group of statements, while the with statement allows the execution of initialization and finalization code around a block of code. Function and class definitions are also syntactically compound statements."
